  <h1>Scenery description in XML</h1>

  <h2>0 About this document</h2>
    
    <p>
      This document describes version 3 of the CRRCsim scenery file format.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Disclaimer:</b> This document is not complete yet. It may be inaccurate
      or wrong, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      This document does not provide complete examples. Please take a look at
      the scenery files you got when downloading/installing CRRCsim. The file
      <tt>simple.xml</tt> in CRRCsim's <tt>scenery</tt> folder demonstrates
      many of the features discussed in this document.
    </p>
    <p>
      You need to know basics about xml files: they are structured text. Whitespace
      and line breaks do not matter in most places. Just take a look at the
      examples and you will understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      The files can be edited using a text editor. There are lots of them. Use
      something like Notepad++, vi, emacs, joe... Even the standard Windows notepad
      will do, but it is recommended to use an editor that features syntax
      highlighting for XML files to spot any obvious formatting errors immediately.

  <h2>1 General information</h2>

  <p>Like most other XML files used in CRRCsim, a scenery description starts with
  the XML file header and a changelog.
  Whenever you edit such a file, please add a new <tt>change</tt> section and fill
  in what is needed. The example below shows a template.</p>

<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
  
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;

&lt;crrcsimSceneryFile version=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
  
  &lt;!-- Some general information --&gt;
  &lt;name&gt;My scenery&lt;/name&gt;
  &lt;categories&gt;
    &lt;category&gt;Field&lt;/category&gt;
  &lt;/categories&gt;
  &lt;description&gt;
    &lt;en&gt;My first scenery file for CRRCsim.&lt;/en&gt;
  &lt;/description&gt;
  &lt;changelog&gt;
    &lt;change&gt;
      &lt;date&gt;2009-12-20&lt;/date&gt;
      &lt;author&gt;Jan Reucker (slowhand_47@gmx.de)&lt;/author&gt;
      &lt;en&gt;Created.&lt;/en&gt;
    &lt;/change&gt;
  &lt;/changelog&gt;
  
  </pre></div>

  <p>Every text is written in english, so it is enclosed in <tt>&lt;en&gt; &lt;/en&gt;</tt>.
  If you want to add something in italian for example, you should enclose it in
  <tt>&lt;it&gt; &lt;/it&gt;</tt>. <i>Other languages than <tt>en</tt> are not
  supported yet by CRRCsim, so at the time of writing information in other languages
  is solely visible for those reading or editing your scenery file directly.</i></p>


  <h2>2 Units</h2>
    <p>
      All numeric attribute values in a scenery file are written as plain numbers
      without engineering units. All length or position values are assumed to
      be in feet (ft).
    </p>

  <h2>3 Coordinate system</h2>
    <p>
      All positional values are specified using the following attributes:
      
      <table border ="1">
        <tr><th>Attribute</th>
            <th>Axis (internal)</th>
            <th>Direction</th></tr>
        <tr><td>north</td><td>x</td><td>positive north, negative south</td></tr>
        <tr><td>east</td><td>y</td><td>positive east, negative west</td></tr>
        <tr><td>height</td><td>-z</td><td>positive up, negative down</td></tr>
      </table>
    </p>
    <p>The attributes listed in the table above are used in all tags
    specifying some kind of position. In earlier versions of CRRCsim, the
    attributes <tt>x</tt>, <tt>y</tt> and <tt>z</tt> were used. This is
    still possible for specifying object positions in a model-based
    scenery (for compatibility reasons), but it's strongly discouraged and
    may be removed in future versions of CRRCsim without further notice.</p>

  <h2>4 Player positions: section <tt>views</tt></h2>
  <p>This section defines possible viewpoints for the player. <i>Currently
  CRRCsim will only use the first <tt>position</tt> that is found in the <tt>views</tt>
  section.</i></p>

  <div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
  
  &lt;views&gt;
    &lt;position name=&quot;default&quot; north=&quot;0&quot; east=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;4&quot;  /&gt;
  &lt;/views&gt;

  </pre></div>
  
  
  <h2>5 Starting positions: section <tt>start</tt></h2>
  <p>The starting position for the model. As with
  the player position, you may specify more than one starting location. The 
  topmost position will be used as default.</p>
  
  
  <div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">

  &lt;start&gt;
    &lt;position name=&quot;field&quot; north=&quot;0&quot; east=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;4&quot;  /&gt;
  &lt;/start&gt;

  </pre></div>

  <h2>6 Default values: section <tt>default</tt></h2>
  <p>Some default values. Right now, you may only specify the default wind
  parameters.</p>

  <div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">

  &lt;default&gt;
    &lt;wind velocity=&quot;3&quot; direction=&quot;180&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/default&gt;

  </pre></div>

  <h2>7 Appearance of the sky: section <tt>sky</tt></h2>
  <p>
    The appearance of the sky is determined by the <tt>&lt;sky&gt;</tt> tag.
    There are two different types of sky available: a sky dome and a sky box.
    A scenery file can contain an arbitrary number of sky definitions. This
    allows for simulating different weather conditions or time of day, or
    providing different texture resolutions to adapt textured skies to the
    available GPU power.
  </p>
  
  <h3>7.1 General description</h3>
  <p>
    The sky section should contain a brief description, which is in turn
    composed of a long and a short description. The short description is used
    in menus or list boxes, while the long description may contain some more
    information.
  </p>

  <div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
  
  &lt;descr_short&gt;
    &lt;en&gt;default&lt;/en&gt;
  &lt;/descr_short&gt;
  &lt;descr_long&gt;
    &lt;en&gt;The default sky box with 512x512 pixel textures.&lt;/en&gt;
  &lt;/descr_long&gt;
  </pre></div>
  
  <h3>7.2 Sky dome</h3>
  <p>
    The sky dome produces a sky like in the first CRRCsim version.
    Think of it as a textured semi-sphere above your head. You can set the
    texture and the radius of the semi-sphere.
  </p>
  
  <div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
  
  &lt;sky type=&quot;original&quot; texture=&quot;textures/clouds.rgb&quot; radius=&quot;10000&quot;&gt;
    &lt;descr_short&gt;
      &lt;en&gt;original&lt;/en&gt;
    &lt;/descr_short&gt;
    &lt;descr_long&gt;
      &lt;en&gt;The original CRRCsim textured sky dome.&lt;/en&gt;
    &lt;/descr_long&gt;
  &lt;/sky&gt;
  </pre></div>
  
  <p>If you omit the texture name, CRRCsim will generate an untextured but
  colored (from grey haze on the horizon to deep blue in the zenith)
  semi-sphere. This may help those people with broken OpenGL implementations
  that don't get the textured dome right.</p>
  
  <div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
  
  &lt;sky type=&quot;original&quot; /&gt;
  </pre></div>

  <h3>7.3 Sky box</h3>
  <p>After CRRCsim version 0.9.6, a new sky rendering method was implemented:
  The sky box. It's nothing but a cube with the viewer/player in the middle.
  A texture can be projected onto each cube face. If the textures are
  seamless and feature the right kind of distortion for the cubical
  projection, this will give a very realistic impression of the sky.</p>
  
  
  <div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
  
  &lt;sky type=&quot;box&quot; size=&quot;10.0&quot;&gt;
    &lt;descr_short&gt;
      &lt;en&gt;default&lt;/en&gt;
    &lt;/descr_short&gt;
    &lt;descr_long&gt;
      &lt;en&gt;The default sky box with 512x512 pixel textures.&lt;/en&gt;
    &lt;/descr_long&gt;
    &lt;textures&gt;
      &lt;north filename=&quot;textures/skybox_n.rgb&quot; /&gt;
      &lt;south filename=&quot;textures/skybox_s.rgb&quot; /&gt;
      &lt;west  filename=&quot;textures/skybox_w.rgb&quot; /&gt;
      &lt;east  filename=&quot;textures/skybox_e.rgb&quot; /&gt;
      &lt;up    filename=&quot;textures/skybox_u.rgb&quot; /&gt;
      &lt;down  filename=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;/textures&gt;
  &lt;/sky&gt;
  </pre></div>

  <p>Cube faces without a texture will not be rendered.</p>

  <p>There are several tools available that deal with artificial landscape/sky
  generation. Most of them should be able to generate a set of textures for the
  sky box. TerraGen, for example, works like a charm. Just generate a flat
  terrain (remember, we're interested in the sky, not the terrain!) and set up
  the sky. Set up the camera with a 90 degrees field of vision (FOV) in the
  center of the terrain at zero altitude, zero pitch, heading north. Render
  a 512x512 pixel image (or any other power-of-two square format, like 256x256
  or 1024x1024, if your graphics card can handle it). This is the &quot;north&quot;
  texture. Now only change the camera heading to 90 deg. and render the
  &quot;east&quot; texture, while 180 deg. and 270 deg. are the setups for
  &quot;south&quot; and &quot;west&quot;. Then point the camera back north and
  pitch it up 90 degrees to render the &quot;up&quot; texture. If you also want
  to add a &quot;down&quot; texture, pitch the camera down to -90 degrees while
  looking north and render. Remember to save all textures after rendering! The
  textures will be saved as &quot;.bmp&quot; (Windows bitmap) files, please
  convert them to SGI format (&quot;.rgb&quot;, turning on RLE compression is
  strongly recommended). Then fill in the texture names in the XML file, copy
  the textures to the &quot;textures&quot; subdirectory and enjoy your new sky.
  </p>
  
  <h2>8 Preview</h2>
  <p> A preview image is a small image of the scenery. It is used in the dialogue of scenery selection  <tt>(Options / Location)</tt>.
  This image has to have, preferably,  a dimension of 256x128 pixels and be in a file format accepted by Plib for textures. The format <tt> .jpg </tt> is accepted.<p>
 <p>The file used as preview is indicated by the tag <tt>&lt;preview&gt;</tt> </p> 
     <div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
  &lt;preview filename=&quot;textures/simple_preview.jpg&quot; /&gt;
  </pre></div>
  <h3>Only one preview  by scene</h3>
  <p>The definition is placed at the same level as the other sections</p>

 <h3>Several previews </h3>
 <p>If the scenery contains some variant of sky, it is possible to indicate a specific preview has each. It is necessary for it to put the definition in the accordant sky section.</p>
    <div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
  
  &lt;sky type=&quot;box&quot; size=&quot;10.0&quot;&gt;
    &lt;preview filename=&quot;textures/simple_thunderstorm_preview.jpg&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;descr_short&gt;
      &lt;en&gt;Sky of thunderstorm&lt;/en&gt;
    &lt;/descr_short&gt;
    &lt;textures&gt;
      &lt;north filename=&quot;textures/skybox_th_n.rgb&quot; /&gt;
      &lt;south filename=&quot;textures/skybox_th_s.rgb&quot; /&gt;
      &lt;west  filename=&quot;textures/skybox_th_w.rgb&quot; /&gt;
      &lt;east  filename=&quot;textures/skybox_th_e.rgb&quot; /&gt;
      &lt;up    filename=&quot;textures/skybox_th_u.rgb&quot; /&gt;
      &lt;down  filename=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;/textures&gt;
  &lt;/sky&gt;
  </pre></div>
  <p> It is possible to mix both syntaxes: if a varying of sky has no preview, the generic preview is used.</p>
  
  <h2>9 The scene description: section <tt>scene</tt></h2>
  
  <p>The last tag in the current files tells CRRCsim what to render in addition
  to the sky. This description starts with the <tt>scene</tt> tag. The
  <tt>type</tt> attribute of this tag defines the semantics of the tags inside
  the <tt>scene</tt> section.</p>
  <p> The optional <tt>altitude</tt> attribute of this tag defines the altitude (in feets) of scenery. It is useful in scenery of mountain to take into account the variation of air density. The height parameters in the scenery description are values relative to this altitude.<p>
  
  <h3>Built-in sceneries: <tt>type=&quot;built-in&quot;</tt></h3> 

  <p>There are two built-in sceneries in CRRCsim: Davis field and the slope at
  Cape Cod. To render these sceneries, specify either <tt>DAVIS</tt> or
  <tt>CAPE_COD</tt> as the value of the <tt>variant</tt> attribute of the
  <tt>scene</tt> tag.</p>
  
  <p>Rendering the Davis field scenery:</p>
  <div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">

  &lt;scene type=&quot;built-in&quot; variant=&quot;DAVIS&quot; /&gt;
  </pre></div>

  <p>Rendering the Cape Cod scenery:</p>
  <div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">

  &lt;scene type=&quot;built-in&quot; variant=&quot;CAPE_COD&quot; /&gt;
  </pre></div>

  <p>There's nothing more to configure for these <tt>scene</tt> variants.</p>

  <h3>Model-based sceneries: <tt>type=&quot;model-based&quot;</tt></h3> 

  <h4>Adding objects to the scenery</h4>
  <p>Everything between &lt;scene&gt; and &lt;/scene&gt; describes graphical
  objects. The order of the objects is not important.</p>
  
  <p>The <tt>object</tt> tag loads a 3D model and adds it to the scenery.
  A lot of different file formats are supported. AC3D files (.ac) and
  (.3ds) should work quite well. In theory, the SSG library loads many more
  formats (.x, .dxf, .ase, .atg, .mdl, .flt, .m, .md2, .obj, .tri, VRML), but
  this is not yet tested with CRRCsim due to the lack of models. Other
  SSG-based projects show that it works.</p>
  
  <p>A <tt>terrain</tt> attribute declares the object to be part of the terrain
  contour. This means that the object will add to the terrain height at this
  point and therefore be included in wind calculations. Be careful, each
  <tt>terrain</tt> object will also increase the CPU workload more than
  non-terrain-objects! The default value for the <tt>terrain</tt> attribute
  is &quot;1&quot;, so <tt>terrain=&quot;0&quot;</tt> must explicitely be
  specified to exclude an object from terrain height calculations.</p>
  
  <p>An object can be loaded once and then placed several times in the scenery.
  This saves texture memory, because all textures are shared between the
  instances of the object. Each instance must have position coordinates
  (<tt>north</tt>|<tt>east</tt>|<tt>height</tt>) and optional orientation
  parameters (<tt>h</tt>|<tt>p</tt>|<tt>r</tt> for heading, pitch and roll).
  North, east and height coordinates must always be specified as absolute world
  coordinates (remember, the unit is &quot;ft.&quot;). Heading, pitch and roll
  are related to local body coordinates of the object (in degrees). The
  orientation of the heading/pitch/roll rotations is similar to the
  coordinate system used for the airplane model: heading specifies a rotation 
  around the vertical (z) axis, pitch rotates around the horizontal lateral (y)
  axis, and roll rotates around the longitudinal (x) axis.</p>
  
  <p>Here's a simple example:</p>
  
  <div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">

    &lt;object filename=&quot;freqboard.ac&quot; terrain=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
      &lt;instance north=&quot;20.0&quot; east=&quot;-160&quot; height=&quot;0&quot; h=&quot;90&quot; p=&quot;0&quot; r=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;/object&gt;
  </pre></div>
  
  <p>This frequency board is located 20 feet north and 160 feet west of the
  scene origin. It faces east (it is rotated 90 degrees around the vertical
  axis). The board is excluded from height calculations. </p>

  <h4>Collision boxes</h4>
  <p>If you exclude complex models from being part of the terrain by setting
  <tt>terrain=&quot;0&quot;</tt>, the airplane can fly right through them.
  The usual solution for this issue is to add a collision box to the scene.
  A collision box is an object of very low complexity that is not rendered
  (so it is not visible in the scenery). Instead it is only used for collision
  detection and height calculation.</p>
  
  <p>Although the term &quot;collision box&quot; is widely used for this kind
  of object, their shape is not limited to boxes. In theory, arbitrary objects
  can be loaded, but please bear in mind that the goal of using collision boxes
  is to reduce the triangle count for collision detection, so using a box,
  a pyramid or a similar low-poly shape is a good idea.</p>
  
  <p>The objects can have arbitrary material properties, colours or textures.
  CRRCsim will exclude them completely from the rendering stage, so the models
  don't have to be transparent. But textures and materials will consume memory,
  so the collision objects should be made from a single material without a
  texture.</p>
  
  <p>To add an object as a collision box, simply set the <tt>visible</tt>
  attribute of an object to &quot;0&quot;:</p>
  
  <div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">

    &lt;!-- A collision box for a static aircraft model --&gt;
    &lt;object filename=&quot;aircraft_collbox.ac&quot; visible=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
      &lt;instance north=&quot;-70.0&quot; east=&quot;60&quot; height=&quot;0&quot; h=&quot;45&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;/object&gt;
  </pre></div>

  <h4>Embedded collision boxes</h4>
  <p>Instead of adding two separate objects for the visible representation and
  the collision box, you can combine both objects in a single 3D model file. To
  tell CRRCsim which parts of the 3D model shall be visible and which parts belong
  to the collision box, make use of the node naming feature of your 3D modelling
  tool. CRRCsim will treat everything up to the first space character as the
  part's real name, everything else is interpreted as an attribute. Each attribute
  consists of a plus or minus sign followed directly by a keyword. The following
  attributes are supported:</p>
  
  <table border ="1">
  <tr><th>Attribute</th>
      <th>Effect</th></tr>
  <tr><td>-visible</td><td>Exclude this part from rendering (make it invisible)</td></tr>
  <tr><td>-terrain</td><td>Exclude this part from height-of-terrain calculations</td></tr>
  </table>

  <p>For example, in Blender, each part of a model is called an &quot;object&quot;. You
  can assign individual names to each object. Let's assume that you model a picnic
  table to be placed in your scenery. Create a new object and call it &quot;table -terrain&quot;
  (object panel, edit the datablock name field to read &quot;OB:table -terrain&quot;).
  Model your table. Then create a new object, call it &quot;box -visible&quot; and
  model the collision box. Select table and box and export both to an AC3D model.
  Then add this model to your scenery file in the usual way, but don't specify
  any &quot;terrain&quot; or &quot;visible&quot; attributes in the XML file.
  CRRCsim will automatically make the box invisible and ignore the table for
  height calculations.</p>
