How to control the plane and crrcsim
------------------------------------

Besides mouse/joystick/transmitter input, the following keys can be used:

r              restarts after crash
p              pause/resume simulation
t              toggles training mode which displays the location of the thermals
v              toggles verbosity level (0..3) to display control inputs/FOV/FPS info
h              toggles HUD compass visualisation mode
page up        increase throttle (if you aren't using JOYSTICK or better)
page down      decrease throttle (if you aren't using JOYSTICK or better)
g              toggle landing gear (if function is not mapped to a controller)
b              toggle spoiler/airbrake (if function is not mapped to a controller)
+              zoom in (assuming zoom.control is KEYBOARD)
-              zoom out (assuming zoom.control is KEYBOARD)
right arrow    right rudder
left arrow     left rudder
up/down arrow  elevator
escape         show/hide graphical user interface
q              quit
c              reload model configuration (see note below)



Note on reloading model configuration:
This feature allows you to reread the models parameters while the simulation
is running. Currently this does not affect its graphical representation, but
only its behaviour, so it is useful for adjusting model parameters without 
having to restart CRRCSim.
